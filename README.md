Literacy Test Widget
==========

To add this widget to your Enketo Express installation see [this guidance](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/enketo-express/blob/master/tutorials/34-custom-widgets.md).

Works on all regular (non-minimal) "select multiple" questions with the `"literacy"` appearance. It cannot be used in conjunction with other appearances. It works with all themes, but the Grid Theme is likely most suitable.

Note that this widget is a custom hack for which we cannot device a proper sane XForm syntax. It is therefore not suitable for inclusion in the common Enketo tools and the ODK XForms specification.
